## Waresix dbt project: `data_dbt`

`data_dbt` is dbt project transforms raw data direct to datawarehouse.


## DBT

**[dbt](https://www.getdbt.com/)** enables data analysts and engineers to transform their data using the same practices that software engineers use to build applications.

## Understanding dbt

Analysts using dbt can transform their data by simply writing select statements, while dbt handles turning these statements into tables and views in a data warehouse.

These select statements, or "models", form a dbt project. Models frequently build on top of one another â€“ dbt makes it easy to [manage relationships](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/ref) between models, and [visualize these relationships](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/documentation), as well as assure the quality of your transformations through [testing](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/testing).



## Getting started

- [Install dbt](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/installation)
```
pip install dbt
```
- Clone repository https://github.com/waresix/data-dbt
```
git clone https://github.com/waresix/data-dbt
```
- Add your profile.yml to data-dbt directory
```
waresix_dbt:  # this needs to match the profile: in your dbt_project.yml file
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      type: postgres
      host: "{{ env_var('HOST_DWH') }}"
      user: "{{ env_var('USER_DWH') }}"
      pass: "{{ env_var('PASS_DWH') }}"
      port: 54324
      dbname: pg_raw 
      schema: dbt_dev
      threads: 1
      keepalives_idle: 0
    prod:
      type: postgres
      host: "{{ env_var('HOST_DWH') }}"
      user: "{{ env_var('USER_DWH') }}"
      pass: "{{ env_var('PASS_DWH') }}"
      port: 54324
      dbname: pg_gold 
      schema: dbt_prod
      threads: 1
